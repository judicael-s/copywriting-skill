# Copywriting Skill

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Copywriting toolkit for AI agents. 4 skills covering English web and email copy, French copy, social media (LinkedIn + X), and brand voice creation. Built on persuasion principles from Eddie Shleyner, Drayton Bird, Claude Hopkins, and other direct-response masters, with a built-in anti-AI-detection layer that makes all output sound human.

Part of the [Marketing Intelligence Suite](https://github.com/judicael-s) alongside [Google Trends](https://github.com/judicael-s/google-trends-skill), [Google Analytics](https://github.com/judicael-s/google-analytics-skill), and [Google Search Console](https://github.com/judicael-s/google-search-console-skill).

## Skills

| Skill | What it does | Trigger phrases |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **copywriting** | Write/improve web page and email copy (homepage, landing, pricing, feature, about, email, ads) with persuasion frameworks from Shleyner + Bird | "write copy for", "headline help", "CTA copy", "value proposition", "email copy", "subject line" |
| **french-copywriting** | Write marketing copy in French with native rules (tu/vous, typography, cultural nuance) | "French copy", "redaction web", "landing page francais" |
| **social-copywriting** | Write platform-native posts for LinkedIn and X/Twitter | "LinkedIn post", "tweet", "thread", "write a post for" |
| **tone-of-voice** | Generate a reusable brand voice guide through interactive questionnaire | "tone of voice", "brand voice", "how should we sound" |

## What Makes This Different

**Principles-based, not template-based.** Core skill is built on persuasion frameworks distilled from 250 newsletter emails by Eddie Shleyner (VeryGoodCopy) and Drayton Bird (64 years of direct-response). Includes Bird's targeting hierarchy, Hopkins' preemptive claims, Collier's emotional levers, and a 10-point copy review checklist. Not just fill-in-the-blank templates.

**Human voice by default.** Every skill enforces anti-AI-detection rules: banned vocabulary (50+ AI-flagged words replaced), punctuation limits (em dash cap), sentence rhythm variance (burstiness), and structural rules. Copy that sounds like a person wrote it.

**Web pages and email.** Root skill handles homepage, landing, pricing, feature, and about page copy. Email frameworks (newsletter structure, sales email structure, subject lines) load automatically when the task involves email.

**Research before writing.** Every skill can optionally research competitors, customer language, and market context via web search before generating copy.

**French-native.** Not translated English. Built with French typography rules, cultural nuance, tu/vous decision matrices, and French-specific AI detection avoidance.

**Cross-skill integration.** Run `tone-of-voice` first to generate a brand voice guide. All other skills automatically load and follow it.

## How Skills Work Together

```
tone-of-voice (run first)
    -> generates .agents/tone-of-voice.md
        -> copywriting reads it
        -> french-copywriting reads it
        -> social-copywriting reads it
```

All skills also check for `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` (from [marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) suite).
